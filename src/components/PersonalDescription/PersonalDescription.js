            <p>In 2021 I moved from Barcelona to the beautiful city of Prague to start a Software Development Engineer position at Oracle. My current focus relies on developing features and fixing bugs in Visual Builder, a cloud-based platform designed for collaborative application development.</p>
            <p>I dedicate most of my time working on the Javascript ecosystem, although recently I’ve been more focused on Preact components alongside Typescript.</p>
            <p>I'm always keen into exploring new technologies and expand my knowledge. In 2023 I got certified as a Java SE 8 Programmer Oracle Certified Associate, mainly motivated by the fact that most of my team works in the backend.</p>
